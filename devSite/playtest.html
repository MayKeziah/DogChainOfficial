          <h2>Playtest Reports</h2>
          Playtests:
          <ul>
            <li>Alpha Prototype</li>
            <li>Beta Prototype</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Alpha Playtest</h3>
          <p>
            This playtest session was performed during the Alpha phase of our development on 5/24.
          </p>
          <p>
            How the game was playtested:<br>
            This playtest was conducted by having classmates test the game over Zoom, and 
            streaming their gameplay to us. At least one of us was there at all times to 
            answer questions about the game. Feedback was collected through three primary 
            methods: observational and conversational feedback recorded by the person attending 
            the playtesters, a survey handed out to all playtesters created by us with specific 
            questions about the game, and a survey for the class created by Professor Pisan 
            which playtesters had to fill out with general questions about the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we learned was: <br>
            We focused primarily on the observational feedback when considering how to change 
            our game, although the other forms of feedback were taken into consideration. 
            These were our primary findings from this playtest:
            <ul>
              <li>Player movement felt great</li>
              <li>Dog following felt choppy and awkward</li>
              <li>The player hitbox felt unfair</li>
            </ul>
            As a result, dogs were set to follow more smoothly, and the player sprite was given a square outline to indicate its boundaries.

          </p>

          <h3>Beta Playtest</h3>
          <p>
            This playtest session was performed during the Final phase of our development on 6/2. 
          </p>
          <p>
            How the game was playtested: <br>
            This playtest, similarly to the first playtest, was conducted by having classmates 
            and other peers from UWB test the game over Zoom, and streaming their gameplay to us. 
            At least one of us was there at all times to answer questions about the game. 
            Feedback was collected through three primary methods: observational and conversational 
            feedback recorded by the person attending the playtesters, a survey handed out to all 
            playtesters created by us with specific questions about the game, and a survey for the 
            class created by Professor Pisan which playtesters had to fill out with general 
            questions about the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we learned was: <br>
            We focused primarily on the observational feedback when considering how to change 
            our game, although the other forms of feedback were taken into consideration. 
            These were our primary findings from this playtest:
            <ul>
              <li>Due to the complexity of the map, it was easy to get lost.</li>
              <li>Doors did not show the amount of dogs needed to open, which was confusing.</li>
            </ul>
            To solve this, small indicators have been placed around the map which point back to the ship, 
            and doors will now have a small sign next to them indicating the dog requirement.
          </p>
