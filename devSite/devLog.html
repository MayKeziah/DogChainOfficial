							<h2>Development Log</h2>
							<p>
								[Edited: 6/7/2021] This log lists the work completed by each developer throughout the 
								duration of the project. The project is broken down by weeks to show the work content of our
								sprints. Our work-weeks ended on Friday with our weekly status report meetings.

											<td>5/21/21</td>
											<td>Overview</td>

												This week, we started working on our Alpha Prototype. We developed the foundation for our game 
												by adding the code that allowed our mechanics to interact smoothly, and we started work
												on auto-generating the more redundant assets of the game (bricks for the walls, 
												bricks for the doors).

										<tr>
											<td></td>
											<td>Jacob</td>
											<td>
												<ul>
													<li>Improve on the player movement script to allow the player to collide with
														walls and doors
													</li>
													<li>Create a door script to allow doors to open when enough dogs are collected 
														(eventually switched to Keziah's implementation so that it smoothly interfaced 
													with the level-editor's deserializing script) 
												</li>
												</ul>

											<td>
												Recently completed:
												<ul>
													<li>All mechanics are integrated into a single scene</li>
												</ul>
												Development Obstacles:
												<ul>
													<li>
														We wanted to keep a record of our previous work, so we kept our Digital
														Prototype code and our Alpha Prototype code in the same root folder. 
														This started creating major namespace conflicts that we did not understand. 
													</li>
												</ul>
												Reflection on Current State:
												<ul>
													<li>We had a successful presentation of our isolated mechanics which had us ranked 
														at the top of the class by our peers in a feedback form.
													</li>
													<li>We had the foundation of the game set with our integrated mechanics.</li>
													<li>Next step is to work on interfacing between mechanics to make the Alpha Prototype 
														presentation a playable version.

											<td>5/28/21</td>

												Alpha Prototype and split up a list of backlog items to work on for our next deliverable.
											</td>

											<td></td>
											<td>Kez</td>

											<td>Additional Notes</td>
											<td>
												Recently completed:
												<ul>
													<li>Finished the level-editor, the Alpha Prototype, conducted our first
														playtest, and designed the layout for our map.
													</li>
												</ul>
												Development Obstacles:
												<ul>
													<li>
														We ran into a strange issue with unity where it would randomly duplicate every script 
														in multiple places, rendering the entire unity project unstable until each duplicate 
														was found and removed. 
													</li>
												</ul>
												Alpha Playtest: <br>
												<i>what we learned</i> 
												<ul>
													<li>The player movement felt great to users</li>
													<li>The dog's following movement felt choppy</li>
													<li>The player hitbox felt ambiguous and unfair</li>
												</ul>
												<i>How we responded:</i>
												<ul>
													<li>Dog movement was made more smooth</li>
													<li>The player sprite was given a box outline to indicate its boundaries</li>
												</ul>
												Reflection on Current State:
												<ul>
													<li>We had a major time crunch this week. We expected the Prototype to be due Tuesday afternoon 
														and playable on Wednesday afternoon. We found out on the weekend that the due date was moved up 
														to Monday. This meant that instead of using the level-editor to create a map, we had to throw 
														together a quick, unplanned, hard to navigate map that users did not like. 
													</li>
													<li>We got lots of useful feedback from our playtest.</li>
													<li>Next step is to make a list of backlog items from the feedback we received and work on the 
														Beta Prototype.
													</li>

											<td></td>
											<td>Additional Notes</td>
											<td>
												Recently completed:
												<ul>
													<li>Finished the Beta prototype (with full map, friction zones, audio, etc.), presented our 
														progress to the class, and conducted our final playtest.
													</li>
												</ul>
												Development Obstacles:
												<ul>
													<li>
														The game required very little work, but we struggled with the time crunsh of finishing our 
														deliverables during finals and final project deadlines.
													</li>
												</ul>
												Alpha Playtest: <br>
												<i>what we learned</i> 
												<ul>
													<li>Due to the complexity of the map, users got lost and struggled to find their way back to the ship.</li>
													<li>Doors were not clearly labeled with the number of dogs required to unlock them.</li>
												</ul>
												<i>How we responded:</i>
												<ul>
													<li>We added signs pointing to the ship at all intersections.</li>
													<li>We added labels next to all doors with the number of dogs needed to open them.</li>
												</ul>
												Reflection on Current State:
												<ul>
													<li>We had great success with our final playtest. The class loved it and laughed at 
														the light-hearted audio assets.
													</li>
													<li>Next step is to finish polishing the game and complete the final deliverables.
													</li>
